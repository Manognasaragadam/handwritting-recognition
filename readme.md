# Handwriting recognition

This project is created to recognize handwritten words from [IAM database](http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database). 

## Getting Started

You should have Python and Pip installed.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python main.py
```

This will download the dataset automatically, create directory structure and train the model.
